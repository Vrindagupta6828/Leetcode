/* Question:
Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2000
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106  */

//Solution 1(o(n^2) time and o(n) space)
class Solution {
    public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int N = nums.length;
        if (N <= 1) return N;
        int[] lengths = new int[N]; //lengths[i] = length of longest ending in nums[i]
        int[] counts = new int[N]; //count[i] = number of longest ending in nums[i]
        Arrays.fill(counts, 1);

        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; ++i) if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                if (lengths[i] >= lengths[j]) {
                    lengths[j] = lengths[i] + 1;
                    counts[j] = counts[i];
                } else if (lengths[i] + 1 == lengths[j]) {
                    counts[j] += counts[i];
                }
            }
        }

        int longest = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int length: lengths) {
            longest = Math.max(longest, length);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (lengths[i] == longest) {
                ans += counts[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
