/* Question:
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?  */

//Solution
class Solution {
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String S, String T) {
        return build(S).equals(build(T));
    }

    public String build(String S) {
        Stack<Character> ans = new Stack();
        for (char c: S.toCharArray()) {
            if (c != '#')
                ans.push(c);
            else if (!ans.empty())
                ans.pop();
        }
        return String.valueOf(ans);
    }
}
