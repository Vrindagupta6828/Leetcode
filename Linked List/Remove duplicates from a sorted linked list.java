/* Question:
Write a function which takes a list sorted in non-decreasing order and deletes any duplicate nodes from the list. The list should only be traversed once. 
For example if the linked list is 11->11->11->21->43->43->60 then removeDuplicates() should convert the list to 11->21->43->60.   */

//Solution 1
 void removeDuplicates() 
    { 
        /*Another reference to head*/
        Node curr = head; 
  
        /* Traverse list till the last node */
        while (curr != null) { 
             Node temp = curr; 
            /*Compare current node with the next node and  
            keep on deleting them until it matches the current  
            node data */
            while(temp!=null && temp.data==curr.data) { 
                temp = temp.next; 
            } 
            /*Set current node next to the next different  
            element denoted by temp*/
            curr.next = temp; 
            curr = curr.next; 
        } 
    }
