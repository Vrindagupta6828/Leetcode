/* Question:
Given a linked list and two keys in it, swap nodes for two given keys. Nodes should be swapped by changing links. Swapping data of nodes may be expensive in many situations when data contains many fields. 
It may be assumed that all keys in the linked list are distinct.
Examples: 

Input:  10->15->12->13->20->14,  x = 12, y = 20
Output: 10->15->20->13->12->14

Input:  10->15->12->13->20->14,  x = 10, y = 20
Output: 20->15->12->13->10->14

Input:  10->15->12->13->20->14,  x = 12, y = 13
Output: 10->15->13->12->20->14  */

//Solution
public void swapNodes(int x, int y) 
    { 
        // Nothing to do if x and y are same 
        if (x == y) return; 
  
        // Search for x (keep track of prevX and CurrX) 
        Node prevX = null, currX = head; 
        while (currX != null && currX.data != x) 
        { 
            prevX = currX; 
            currX = currX.next; 
        } 
  
        // Search for y (keep track of prevY and currY) 
        Node prevY = null, currY = head; 
        while (currY != null && currY.data != y) 
        { 
            prevY = currY; 
            currY = currY.next; 
        } 
  
        // If either x or y is not present, nothing to do 
        if (currX == null || currY == null) 
            return; 
  
        // If x is not head of linked list 
        if (prevX != null) 
            prevX.next = currY; 
        else //make y the new head 
            head = currY; 
  
        // If y is not head of linked list 
        if (prevY != null) 
            prevY.next = currX; 
        else // make x the new head 
            head = currX; 
  
        // Swap next pointers 
        Node temp = currX.next; 
        currX.next = currY.next; 
        currY.next = temp; 
    }
